# React Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of basic projects I built while learning React and Tailwind CSS, using React + Vite for project setup. Each project demonstrates different features and concepts, showcasing my progress and understanding of these technologies.

## Projects Overview

1. [Background Changer](./bgchanger)
   - A simple app to change the background color using React and Tailwind CSS.
2. [Password Generator](./passwordGenerator)
   - An app to generate strong passwords with customizable options.
3. [Currency Converter](./currencyConverter)
   - A currency conversion application that uses real-time exchange rates.
4. [React Router Example](./reactRouter)
   - Demonstrates the use of React Router for navigating between different pages.
5. [Theme Changer](./themeChanger)
   - An app that allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
6. [Todo App with Context API](./todo_contextAPI)
   - A Todo list application that manages state using React's Context API.
7. [Todo App with Redux](./todo_redux)
   - A Todo list application that manages state using Redux.
8. [Facebook Login Page Clone](./facebook-login-page)
   - A clone of the Facebook login page built using Tailwind CSS.

## Concepts Learned
Through these projects, I have learned and implemented the following concepts:

- **React Hooks**: Utilized hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`,`useDataLoader`..,etc and custom hooks to manage component state and side effects.
- **State Management**: Used Context API and Redux for managing state across components.
- **React Router**: Implemented navigation and dynamic routing using React Router.
- **Components**: Built reusable and modular components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled components using utility-first CSS with Tailwind.
- **Vite**: Leveraged Vite for fast project setup and development.

## Setup

To run any of these projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sunnny-yadav/react-learning-projects.git
   cd react-learning-projects

2. Navigate to the desired project directory:
   ```bash 
   cd project-name
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash 
   npm run dev

## Lessons Learned

Each project helped me deepen my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS. I have become more proficient in:

- **Building and styling responsive user interfaces**.
- **Managing state effectively using Context API and Redux**.
- **Implementing routing and navigation in React applications**.
- **Using hooks to manage state and side effects in functional components**.
